                Ask Nepal helps you find information about the Nepal government and its public bodies. Ask Nepal helps access information about local government, central government, parliament, state funded schools, universities, hospitals and other public authorities.

                You choose the <a href="https://asknepal.info/body/list/all"> public authority </a> that you would like information from. After that you write a brief note describing what you want to know. Ask Nepal then sends your request to the public authority. Any response received is automatically published on the website for you and anyone else to find, read and use.

                Government in Nepal impacts your life in many ways. The quality of roads, hospitals, schools, our environment, or the government's ability to supply electricity affects our lives. There are some things government in Nepal is doing well and there are some areas where it struggles to provide better services. 
                <br></br>
                The more you know about your government, the better you will be able to make suggestions to improve the things that Nepal government struggles to do well. This website also helps many journalists, students, and professionals as they do their research.
